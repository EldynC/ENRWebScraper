# ENRWebScraper
- This python web scraper grabs the list of top Texas & Lousiana Contractors and creates a boolean search string for all the companies
- By using the BeautiulSoup python package, I was able to grab the data from the website tables and create the search strings to search     for candidates on LinkedIn using their search engine.
- Because the scraper only works for the URL in the url variable, to grab companies from different lists the code will need to be modified

#To-Do
- Create multiple python scripts for different company lists on ENR & other websites.
- Add a feature that allows user to enter any link and automatically grab companies from different lists.
